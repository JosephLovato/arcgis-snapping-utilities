# arcgis-snapping-utilities

This library provides snapping utilities for the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript. 

ðŸš§ **Currently under development** ðŸš§

## Ongoing work

Snapping for points is currently being developed, including:

- `snapPointToPoints`: snaps a point geometry to the nearest point geometry in a feature layer
- `snapPointToPolylinePoints`: snaps a point geometry to the nearest point on a polyline geometry
- `snapPointToPolylinePaths`: snaps a point geometry to the nearest path on a polyline (shortest distance to actual line segments)
